    <h2>Benefits of JSON-LD and LD-Proofs</h2>

    <p>
The Verifiable Credentials Data Model is designed to be compatible with a
variety of existing and emerging syntaxes and digital proof formats. Each
approach has benefits and drawbacks. The following table is intended to
summarize a number of these native trade-offs.
    </p>

    <p>
The table below compares three syntax and proof format ecosystems; JSON+JWTs,
JSON-LD+JWTs, and JSON-LD+LD-Proofs. Readers should be aware that
Zero-Knowledge Proofs are currently proposed as a sub-type of LD-Proofs and
thus fall into the final column below.

Some of the features listed in the table above are debateable since a feature
can always be added to a particular syntax or digital proof format. The table
is intended to identify native features of each combination such that no
additional language design or extension is required to achieve the identified
feature. Features that all languages provide, such as the ability to express
numbers, have not been included for the purposes of brevity.

    <dl>
      <dt id="pf1">
PF1: Support for open world data modelling
      </dt>
      <dd>
An <em>open world data model</em> is one where any entity can make any
statement about anything while simultaneously ensuring that the semantics of
the statement are unambiguous. This specification is enabled by an open world
data model called Linked Data. One defining characteristic of supporting an open
world data model is the ability to specify the semantic context in which data
is being expressed. JSON-LD provides this mechanism via the
<code>@context</code> property. JSON has no such feature.
      </dd>
      <dt id="pf2">
PF2: Universal identifier mechanism for JSON objects via the use of URIs.
      </dt>
      <dd>
All entities in a JSON-LD document are identified either via an automatic URI,
or via an explicit URI. This enables all entities in a document to be
unambiguously referenced. JSON does not have a native URI type nor does it
require objects to have one, making it difficult to impossible to unambiguously
identify an entity expressed in JSON.
      </dd>
      <dt id="pf3">
PF3: A way to disambiguate properties shared among different JSON documents by
mapping them to IRIs via a context.
      </dt>
      <dd>
All object properties in a JSON-LD document, such as the property "homepage",
are either keywords or they are mapped to an IRI. This feature enables open
world systems to identify the semantic meaning of the property in an unambiguous
way, which enables seamless merging of data between disparate systems.
JSON object properties are not mapped to IRIs, which result in ambiguities with
respect to the semantic meaning of the property. For example, one JSON document
can use "title" (meaning "book title") in a way that is semantically
incompatible with another JSON document using "title" (meaning "job title").
      </dd>
      <dt id="pf4">
PF4: A mechanism to refer to data in an external document, where the data may
be merged with the local document without a merge conflict in semantics or
structure.
      </dt>
      <dd>
JSON-LD provides a mechanism that enables a data value to use a URL to refer
to data outside of the local document. This external data may then be
automatically merged with the local document without a merge conflict in
semantics or structure. This feature enables a system to apply the
"follow your nose" principle to discover a richer set of data that is
associated with the local document. While a JSON document can contain pointers
to external data, interpreting the pointer is often application specific and
usually does not support merging the external data to construct a richer data
set.
      </dd>
      <dt id="pf5">
PF5: The ability to annotate strings with their language.
      </dt>
      <dd>
JSON-LD enables a developer to specify the language, such as English, French,
or Japanese, in which a text string is expressed via the use of language tags.
JSON does not provide such a feature.
      </dd>
      <dt id="pf6">
PF6: A way to associate arbitrary datatypes, such as dates
and times, with arbitrary property values.
      </dt>
      <dd>
JSON-LD enables a developer to specify the data type of a property value,
such as Date, unsigned integer, or Temperature by specifying it in the
JSON-LD Context. JSON does not provide such a feature.
      </dd>
      <dt id="pf7">
PF7: A facility to express one or more directed graphs, such as a social
network, in a single document.
      </dt>
      <dd>
JSON-LD's abstract data model supports the expression of information
as a directed graph of labeled nodes and edges, which enables an open world
data model to be supported. JSON's abstract data model only supports the
expression of information as a tree of unlabeled nodes and edges, which
restricts the types of relationships and structures that can be natively
expressed in the language.
      </dd>
      <dt id="pf8">
PF8: Supports signature sets.
      </dt>
      <dd>
A signature set is an unordered set of signatures over a data payload. Use
cases, such as cryptographic signatures applied to a legal contract,
typically require more than one signature to be associated with the contract
in order to legally bind two or more parties under the terms of the contract.
Linked Data Proofs, including Linked Data Signatures, natively support sets of
signatures. JWTs only enable a single signature over a single payload.
      </dd>
      <dt id="pf9">
PF9: Embeddable in HTML such that search crawlers will index the
machine-readable content.
      </dt>
      <dd>
All major search crawlers natively parse and index information expressed as
JSON-LD in HTML pages. LD-Proofs enable the current data format that search
engines use to be extended to support digital signatures. JWTs have no mechanism
to express data in HTML pages and are currently not indexed by search crawlers.
      </dd>
      <dt id="pf10">
PF10: Data on the wire is easy to debug and serialize to database systems.
      </dt>
      <dd>
When developers are debugging software systems, it is beneficial for them to be
able to see the data that they are operating on using common debugging tools.
Similarly, it is useful to be able to serialize data from the network to a
database and then from the database back out to the network using a minimal
number of pre and post processing steps. LD-Proofs enable developers to use
common JSON tooling without having to convert the format into a different
format or structure. JWTs base-64 encode payload information, resulting in
complicated pre and post processing steps to convert the data into JSON data
while not destroying the digital signature. Similarly, schema-less databases,
which are typically used to index JSON data, cannot index information
that is expressed in an opaque base-64 encoded wrapper.
      </dd>
      <dt id="pf11">
PF11: Nesting signed data does not cause data size to double for every
embedding.
      </dt>
      <dd>
When a JWT is encapsulated by another JWT, the entire payload must be base-64
encoded in the initial JWT, and then base-64 encoded again in the encapsulating
JWT. This is often necessary when a cryptographic signature is required on a
document that contains a cryptographic signature, such as when a Notary
signs a document that has been signed by someone else seeking the Notary's
services. LD-Proofs do not require base-64 encoding the signed portion of a
document and instead rely on a canonicalization process that is just as
secure, and that only requires the cryptographic signature to be encoded
instead of the entire payload.
      </dd>
      <dt id="pf12">
PF12: Proof format supports Zero-Knowledge Proofs.
      </dt>
      <dd>
The LD-Proof format is capable of modifying the algorithm that generates
the hash or hashes that are cryptographically signed. This cryptographic
agility enables digital signature systems, such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs,
to be layered on top of LD-Proofs instead of an entirely new digital signature
container format to be created. JWTs are designed such that an entirely new
digital signature container format will be required to support Zero-Knowledge
Proofs.
      </dd>
      <dt id="pf13">
PF13: Proof format supports arbitrary proofs such as Proof of Work, Timestamp
Proofs, and Proof of Stake.
      </dt>
      <dd>
The LD-Proof format was designed with a broader range of proof types in mind
and supports cryptographic proofs beyond simple cryptographic signatures.
These proof types are in common usage in systems such as decentralized ledgers
and provide additional guarantees to
<a>verifiable credentials</a>, such as the ability to prove that a particular
claim was made at a particular time or that a certain amount of energy was
expended to generate a particular credential. The JWT format does not support
arbitrary proof formats.
      </dd>
      <dt id="pf14">
PF14: Proofs can be expressed unmodified in other data syntaxes such as XML,
YAML, N-Quads, and CBOR.
      </dt>
      <dd>
The LD-Proof format utilizes a canonicalization algorithm to generate a
cryptographic hash that is used as an input to the cryptographic proof
algorithm. This enables the bytes generated as the cryptographic proof to be
compact and expressible in a variety of other syntaxes such as XML,
YAML, N-Quads, and CBOR. Since JWTs require the use of JSON to be generated,
they are inextricably tied to the JSON syntax.
      </dd>
      <dt id="pf15">
PF15: Changing property-value ordering, or introducing whitespace does not
invalidate signature.
      </dt>
      <dd>
Since LD-Proofs utilize a canonicalization algorithm, the introduction of
whitespace that does not change the meaning of the information being expressed
has no effect on the final cryptographic hash over the information. This means
that simple changes in whitespace formatting, such as those changes made when
writing data to a schema-less database and then retrieving the same information
from the same database do not cause the digital signature to fail. JWTs
encode the payload using the base-64 format which is not resistant to
whitespace formatting that has no effect on the information expressed. This
shortcoming of JWTs make it challenging to, for example, express signed data in
web pages that search crawlers index.
      </dd>
      <dt id="pf16">
PF16: Designed to easily support experimental signature systems.
      </dt>
      <dd>
The LD-Proof format is naturally extensible, not requiring the format to be
extended in a formal international standards working group in order to
prevent namespace collisions. The JWT format requires entries in a centralized
registry in order to avoid naming collisions and does not support
experimentation as easily as the LD-Proof format does. LD-Proof format
extension is done through the decentralized publication of cryptographic
suites that are guaranteed to not conflict with other LD-Proof
extensions. This approach enables developers to easily experiment with new
cryptographic signature mechanisms that support selective disclosure,
zero-knowledge proofs, and post-quantum algorithms.

PF17: Supports signature chaining.
      </dt>
      <dd>
A signature chain is an ordered set of signatures over a data payload. Use
cases, such as cryptographic signatures applied to a notarized document,
typically require a signature by the signing party and then an additional one
by a notary to be made after the original signing party has made their
signature. Linked Data Proofs, including Linked Data Signatures, natively
support chains of signatures. JWTs only enable a single signature over a
single payload.

PF18: Does not require pre-processing or post-processing.

      <dd>
In order to encode a <a>verifiable credential</a> or a
<a>verifiable presentation</a> in a JWT, an extra set of steps
are required to convert the data to and from the JWT format. No such extra
converstion step are required for <a>verifiable credentials</a> and
<a>verifiable presentations</a> protected by LD-Proofs.

PF19: Canonicalization requires more than base-64 encoding.
      </dt>
      <dd>
The JWT format utilizes a simple base-64 encoding format to generate the
cryptographic hash of the data. The encoding format for LD-Proofs require
a more complex canonicalization algorithm to generate the cryptographic
hash. The benefits of the JWT approach are simplicity at the cost of
encoding flexibility. The benefits of the LD-Proof approach are flexibility at
the cost of implementation complexity.
